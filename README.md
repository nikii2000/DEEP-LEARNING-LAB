# Deep Learning Lab

This repository contains a collection of experiments conducted as part of the Deep Learning Lab course. Each experiment explores different aspects of deep learning, machine learning, and data analysis using various libraries and tools.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: MNIST using NumPy
In this experiment, we implement a neural network to classify the MNIST dataset using only NumPy, focusing on the fundamentals of training a neural network without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Experiment 2: Analyze Non-Linear Dataset using scikit-learn
This experiment explores analyzing and modeling a non-linear dataset using the scikit-learn library. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning models to solve the classification problem.

### Experiment 3: CNN Implementation

In this experiment, we implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images. The goal is to understand the inner workings of a CNN, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, using a dataset such as MNIST or CIFAR-10. We focus on the architecture design, training process, and evaluation of the model's performance.
